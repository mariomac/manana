# Ma√±ana

Yet another futures and promises library for Go.

The library is usable right now. While I write this README, you
can [read the API docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/mariomac/manana)
and [see few examples](examples).

## TODO
* An API to query the progress of the future
* A `Then` continuation future
* A Fluent API (concat function invocations)
* More coordination functions: `Any`, `All`, `Pipe`...
